description: Configure headers, bodies, and authentication
---

This guide covers how to customize the HTTP requests burl sends.

## Custom Headers

Use `-H` or `--header` to add custom headers. This flag can be used multiple times:

```bash
burl https://api.example.com \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  -H "X-Custom-Header: value" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Common Headers

```bash
# API versioning
burl https://api.example.com -H "API-Version: 2024-01"

# Request tracing
burl https://api.example.com -H "X-Request-ID: bench-001"

# Custom user agent
burl https://api.example.com -H "User-Agent: burl/0.1.0"
```

## Request Body

### Inline Body

Use `-b` or `--body` for inline request bodies:

```bash
# JSON body
burl https://api.example.com/users -m POST \
  -b '{"name":"John","email":"john@example.com"}'

# Form data
burl https://api.example.com/login -m POST \
  -b "username=admin&password=secret" \
  -T application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

### Body from File

Use `-B` or `--body-file` to read the body from a file:

```bash
# Read JSON from file
burl https://api.example.com/users -m POST \
  -B payload.json \
  -T application/json

# Read any file
burl https://api.example.com/upload -m POST \
  -B data.bin \
  -T application/octet-stream
```

## Content-Type

Use `-T` or `--content-type` as a shorthand for the Content-Type header:

```bash
# JSON
burl https://api.example.com -m POST -b '{}' -T application/json

# Form data
burl https://api.example.com -m POST -b 'key=value' -T application/x-www-form-urlencoded

# XML
burl https://api.example.com -m POST -b '<root/>' -T application/xml
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
burl https://api.example.com -m POST -b '{}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Authentication

Use `-a` or `--auth` to add authentication. burl supports two authentication types:

### Bearer Token

```bash
burl https://api.example.com -a bearer:your-token-here
```

This adds the header: `Authorization: Bearer your-token-here`

### Basic Auth

```bash
burl https://api.example.com -a basic:username:password
```

This adds the header with base64-encoded credentials.

### Using Environment Variables

For security, use environment variables for tokens:

```bash
# Bearer token from environment
burl https://api.example.com -a bearer:$API_TOKEN

# Basic auth with env vars
burl https://api.example.com -a basic:$API_USER:$API_PASS
```

## TLS Configuration

### Skip Certificate Verification

Use `-k` or `--insecure` to skip TLS certificate verification:

```bash
burl https://self-signed.example.com -k
```

Only use `--insecure` for testing with self-signed certificates. Never use it in production benchmarks.

## Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive example using multiple configuration options:

```bash
burl https://api.example.com/v2/orders \
  -m POST \
  -H "X-API-Version: 2024-01" \
  -H "X-Request-ID: bench-$(date +%s)" \
  -a bearer:$API_TOKEN \
  -b '{"product_id": 123, "quantity": 1}' \
  -T application/json \
  -c 25 \
  -d 60s \
  -t 15s \
  -w 10
```

This benchmark:

- POSTs to the orders endpoint
- Uses API versioning and request tracing headers
- Authenticates with a bearer token
- Sends a JSON order body
- Uses 25 concurrent connections for 60 seconds
- Has a 15 second timeout and 10 warmup requests
