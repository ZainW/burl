This guide covers the fundamental concepts of using burl for HTTP benchmarking.

## The Basic Command

The simplest burl command takes just a URL:

```bash
burl https://api.example.com/health
```

This runs a benchmark with default settings:
- 10 concurrent connections
- 10 second duration
- GET method
- No custom headers

## Concurrent Connections

The `-c` or `--connections` flag controls how many parallel requests burl makes:

```bash
# Light load - 5 connections
burl https://api.example.com -c 5

# Medium load - 50 connections
burl https://api.example.com -c 50

# Heavy load - 200 connections
burl https://api.example.com -c 200
```

More connections doesn't always mean better throughput. Start low and increase gradually to find your server's optimal concurrency.
::

## Duration vs Request Count

You can limit a benchmark by time or by number of requests.

### By Duration (Default)

Use `-d` or `--duration` with a human-readable duration:

```bash
# 30 seconds
burl https://api.example.com -d 30s

# 2 minutes
burl https://api.example.com -d 2m

# 1 hour
burl https://api.example.com -d 1h
```

### By Request Count

Use `-n` or `--requests` to run a fixed number of requests:

```bash
# Exactly 1000 requests
burl https://api.example.com -n 1000

# Quick test - 100 requests
burl https://api.example.com -n 100
```

::u-callout{icon="i-lucide-lightbulb" color="amber"}
When both `-d` and `-n` are specified, the benchmark stops when either limit is reached first.
::

## HTTP Methods

Use `-m` or `--method` to specify the HTTP method:

```bash
# GET (default)
burl https://api.example.com/users

# POST
burl https://api.example.com/users -m POST -b '{"name":"test"}'

# PUT
burl https://api.example.com/users/1 -m PUT -b '{"name":"updated"}'

# DELETE
burl https://api.example.com/users/1 -m DELETE

# PATCH
burl https://api.example.com/users/1 -m PATCH -b '{"status":"active"}'
```

## Request Timeout

Set the maximum time to wait for a response with `-t` or `--timeout`:

```bash
# 5 second timeout
burl https://api.example.com -t 5s

# 1 minute timeout (for slow endpoints)
burl https://api.example.com -t 1m
```

The default timeout is 30 seconds.

## Warmup Requests

Use `-w` or `--warmup` to send warmup requests that aren't counted in statistics:

```bash
# 10 warmup requests before measuring
burl https://api.example.com -w 10
```

Warmup helps:
- Establish connection pools
- Trigger JIT compilation on the server
- Fill caches
- Get more accurate measurements

## Combining Options

Options can be combined freely:

```bash
burl https://api.example.com/users \
  -c 50 \
  -d 60s \
  -m POST \
  -b '{"name":"test"}' \
  -T application/json \
  -w 20 \
  -t 10s
```

This runs:
- 50 concurrent connections
- For 60 seconds
- POST requests with JSON body
- 20 warmup requests first
- 10 second timeout per request

## Exit Codes

burl uses exit codes to indicate success or failure:

| Exit Code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | All requests succeeded (2xx responses) |
| `1` | One or more requests failed |

This is useful in CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
burl https://api.example.com -n 100 || echo "Some requests failed!"
```
