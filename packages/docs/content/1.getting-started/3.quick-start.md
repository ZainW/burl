description: Run your first benchmark in under a minute
---

Let's benchmark an API endpoint in just a few commands.

## Basic Benchmark

Run a 10-second benchmark with 10 concurrent connections (defaults):

```bash
burl https://api.example.com/health
```

## With Custom Options

Increase concurrency and duration:

```bash
burl https://api.example.com/users -c 50 -d 30s
```

| Flag     | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `-c 50`  | Use 50 concurrent connections |
| `-d 30s` | Run for 30 seconds            |

## POST Request with JSON Body

```bash
burl https://api.example.com/users \
  -m POST \
  -b '{"name":"test","email":"test@example.com"}' \
  -T application/json
```

## With Authentication

::u-tabs
:::u-tab{label="Bearer Token"}

```bash
burl https://api.example.com/secure -a bearer:$TOKEN
```

:::

:::u-tab{label="Basic Auth"}

```bash
burl https://api.example.com/secure -a basic:username:password
```

## Export Results

```bash
# JSON output
burl https://api.example.com/health -f json -o results.json

# LLM-optimized with recommendations
burl https://api.example.com/health --llm json
```

## Understanding the Output

When you run a benchmark, burl displays results like this:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  burl - HTTP Benchmark Results
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Target
    URL:         https://api.example.com/health
    Method:      GET
    Connections: 10
    Duration:    10.02s

  Summary
    Total Requests:  1,234
    Successful:      1,234
    Requests/sec:    123.15
    Throughput:      45.23 KB/s

  Latency
    P50:    12.4ms     ← 50% of requests completed in under 12.4ms
    P90:    32.1ms     ← 90% of requests completed in under 32.1ms
    P95:    45.2ms     ← 95% of requests completed in under 45.2ms
    P99:    89.3ms     ← 99% of requests completed in under 89.3ms
```

### Key Metrics

| Metric           | Description                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Requests/sec** | Throughput - how many requests completed per second        |
| **P50 (Median)** | Half of all requests were faster than this                 |
| **P99**          | 99% of requests were faster than this - important for SLAs |
| **Success Rate** | Percentage of requests that returned 2xx status            |
