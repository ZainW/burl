burl can be installed as a pre-built binary or built from source.

## Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install burl is with the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZainW/burl/master/install.sh | bash
```

This automatically detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release, and installs to `~/.burl/bin`.

To install a specific version:

```bash
VERSION=1.0.0 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZainW/burl/master/install.sh | bash
```

To install to a custom location:

```bash
BURL_INSTALL=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZainW/burl/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ZainW/burl/releases).

## From Source

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.5 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZainW/burl
cd burl
bun install
bun run build
```

The compiled binary will be in `packages/cli/dist/`.

## Run Without Installing

You can also run burl directly without building:

```bash
bun run packages/cli/src/index.ts https://example.com
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
burl --version
```

You should see output like:

```
burl v0.1.0
```
